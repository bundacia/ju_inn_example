Hi and welcome to the Gilded Rose. As you know, we are a small inn with a
prime location in a prominent city ran by a friendly innkeeper named Allison.
We also buy and sell only the finest goods. Unfortunately, our goods are
constantly degrading in quality as they approach their sell by date.

Goods have a "sell by" date.

Goods degrade in quality as the "sell by" date appoaches.

Goods have a "quality" which denotes how valuable the item is.

At the end of each day the system should lower both values for every item.

Once the sell by date has passed, Quality degrades twice as fast

The Quality of an item is never negative
